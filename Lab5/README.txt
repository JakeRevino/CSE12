Lab 5: Graphics

------------------------
DESCRIPTION

This lab implements 2 macro functions and 5 subroutines. Each function will display, clear or draw to a bitmap in the form of different shapes. 

------------------------
FILES
-
Lab4.asm

This is the solution I came up with for Lab5.

-------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS

To run this lab, open the Lab5.asm file in MARS simulator. Create a test file that will call each subroutine and macro function. Watch as your input gets displayed to the bitmap display in MARS.
