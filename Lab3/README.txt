------------------------
FILES

-
Lab3.cpp

This file is the lab if it were to be done in C++. I wrote this to help me better understand how to write the code in MIPS.

-
Lab3.asm

This file includes the MIPS code for the lab.

-------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS

To run this lab, open the Lab3.asm file in MARS simulator. When you run the program, the user will be prompted to enter a height greater than 0. Hit enter and watch the pattern get created.
