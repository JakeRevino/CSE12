Lab1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

This lab gives an introduction to using MML. There were 3 parts: A, B, C. Part A requires connecting wires to a 7-segment display. Part B outputs the three bits shown in the truth table given the four bits as input. Part C reduces to 1 output in three different ways: The first has no requirements to wiring, the second is the same circuit using only NAND gates, the third is also the same but requires only using NOR gates.

INSTRUCTIONS

In this lab, the user operates the switches (in_0, in_1, in_2, in_3) on the very first page of the lab document. The switches send a signal to logic circuits on the folling pages. The results can all be seen on the first page.
